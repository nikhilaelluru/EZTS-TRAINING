# In the enchanted land of Numeria, Alice is on a quest to find the legendary Prime Key to unlock the ancient Vault of Secrets. The vault's guardian, an 
# ancient sphinx, presents a multi-step puzzle that Alice must solve to obtain the Prime Key.

# The puzzle consists of multiple levels, each requiring Alice to solve a different challenge involving prime numbers. To progress through each level, Alice must 

# perform the following tasks:

# Level 1: Find the smallest prime number larger than a given integer N.
# Level 2: Calculate the sum of all prime numbers between N and the smallest 
# prime number larger than N.
# Level 3: Determine if the product of the smallest prime number larger than N
# and the next immediate prime number is also a prime.

# To complete the puzzle and retrieve the Prime Key, Alice must solve these challenges in sequence for a given integer N.

# Your task is to write a function that takes an integer N and returns a tuplecontaining the following:
# - The smallest prime number larger than N (Level 1 result).
# - The sum of all prime numbers between N and the smallest prime number larger than N (Level 2 result).
# - A boolean indicating whether the product of the smallest prime number larger than N and the next immediate prime number is prime (Level 3 result).

# Help Alice navigate through the levels, solve the puzzle, and obtain the Prime 
# Key to unlock the Vault of Secrets
