# simplest and problem N being the most difficult. Max is aware that he will require 5*i minutes to solve the ith problem.

# Your task is help Max find and return an integer value, representing the number of problems Max can solve and reach the party 
# venue within the given time frame of 4 hours.

# Note: Max will leave his home at exactly 8 PM to reach the party venue.
# Input Format:
# input1: An integer value N, representing the total number of problems.
# input2: An integer value P, Representing the time to travel in minutes from his home to the party venue.
# Example Input:
