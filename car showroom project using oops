# CAR-SHOWROOM PROJECT USING OOPS
  
# Create a class carshowroom in which
# -  create a function named car company which will allow user to select a car company out of the 
#    displayed companies. If the user enters any random car company he should be asked to re-enter.

# -  According to the car company selected the user should be re-directed to selecting the models 
#    of that company out of the given list. If anything other than list is given ask to re-enter.

# -  After selecting the model, the user should be redirected to selecting the variant(petrol/diesel).
 
# -  According to the car company model and variant a price should be calculated to which sgst and 
#    cgst are added to make up the total price.

# NOTE: cgst and sgst are common for all the cars.
